## Introduction

Think of the Bash shell as the translator between you and your computer's operating system (specifically, if you're using Linux or macOS). When you type commands into the terminal, Bash is the program that understands those commands and tells the operating system what to do. It's like the command center for your computer!

Why is it useful? Well, instead of clicking through menus and interfaces, Bash allows you to perform tasks quickly and efficiently using text-based commands. Imagine you want to find all the files with ".txt" in their name in a specific folder. With a few Bash commands, you can do that in seconds! This becomes incredibly powerful when you want to automate repetitive tasks.

Let's look at a few basic commands you'll use all the time:

- `ls`: This command lists all the files and directories in your current location. It's like opening a folder in a graphical interface.
- `cd`: This stands for change directory. It allows you to navigate between different folders in your file system. For example, `cd Documents` would take you into your "Documents" folder.
- `pwd`: This stands for print working directory. It shows you the full path of the directory you are currently in. Think of it as telling you "you are here" in your computer's file system.

## Getting Started with Bash Scripting

### Hello, world

A Bash script is simply a text file that contains a series of Bash commands. When you run the script, Bash reads the commands in the file and executes them one by one. It's like writing down a recipe of commands for your computer to follow!

The very first line in almost every Bash script is a special one: `#!/bin/bash`. This is called the ***"shebang"*** line. Think of it as telling your operating system, "Hey, the commands in this file should be executed using the Bash interpreter." Without this line, your system might try to run the script with a different program, and it probably wouldn't work as expected.

**So, how do you create a script?**

1. **Open a text editor**: You can use any plain text editor like `nano`, `vim`, `gedit` (on Linux), or even `TextEdit` (on macOS, just make sure to save it as plain text).

2. **Type the *shebang* line**: At the very top of your new file, type `#!/bin/bash`.

3. **Add some commands**: On the lines below the shebang, you can write any Bash commands you've learned or will learn. For a super simple first script, let's use the `echo` command. `echo` simply displays text on your terminal. Try typing `echo "Hello, world!"` on the second line.

4. **Save the file**: Save the file with a name that ends in .sh. This is a common convention for Bash scripts, although it's not strictly required. Let's call our first script `hello.sh`.

5. **Make it executable**: Before you can run your script, you need to tell your system that it's an executable file. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.sh` using the `cd` command, and then run the command: `chmod +x hello.sh`. The `chmod +x` command adds execute permissions to the file.

6. **Run your script**: Now you can finally run your script! In the terminal, type `./hello.sh` and press `Enter`. You should see "Hello, world!" printed on your screen.

> **To quickly recap**:  
> Create a new script file with nano by typing:
>
>```bash
>  nano hello.sh
> ```
>
> That should open the nano program, and be editing the file hello.sh.  
>
> **Inside of `hello.sh`, add the following lines:**
>
> ```bash
> #!/bin/bash
> echo "Hello, world!"
> ```
>
> Now save the script and exit with `Ctrl-o` and `Enter`, followed by `Ctrl-x` to exit `nano`.
> Make the script executable by running the following command in your termnial:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x ./hello.sh
> ```
>
> Now finally run your script, you should be in the same directory you created it in:
>
> ```bash
> ./hello.sh
> ```
>
> You should see the output:
>
> ```shell
> Hello, world!
> ```
>

There was your first basic Bash script.  That wasn't too painful now was it?

### Bash Syntax

Let's go over the Basic Syntax of Bash commands. Think of it as the grammar of the Bash language.

Most Bash commands follow a general structure:

`command [options] [arguments]`

**Let's break this down**:

- `command`: This is the action you want to perform, like ls, cd, or echo.

- `[options]`: These are like modifiers that change how the command behaves. They usually start with a hyphen (`-`). For example, `ls -l` uses the `-l` option to display the output in a long listing format, showing more details about the files and directories.

- `[arguments]`: These are the targets of the command. For example, with the `cd` command, the argument is the directory you want to change to (e.g., `cd Documents`, where "Documents" is the argument). For echo, the argument is the text you want to display (e.g., `echo "Hello"`, where "Hello" is the argument).

We've already seen the echo command in action. It's super useful for displaying messages or the output of other commands.

Another important concept is comments. These are notes that you can add to your scripts to explain what the code is doing. Bash ignores comments when it runs the script. To write a comment, you simply start a line with a hash symbol (`#`). For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment explaining what the script does
echo "Hello, world!" # This comment explains this specific line
```

Comments are incredibly helpful for making your scripts easier to understand, especially as they get more complex.

## Variables and Data

**Variables and Data** in Bash scripting is where you can start storing and manipulating information within your scripts, making them much more dynamic!

Think of a variable as a named storage location in your computer's memory where you can hold a piece of data. It's like labeling a box so you know what's inside. In Bash, you can store different kinds of data in variables, but the most common type you'll work with initially is text, also known as a string.

### Assigning Values to Variables

To assign a value to a variable in Bash, you use the following syntax:

```bash
variable_name=value
```

It's important to note that there should be no spaces around the equals sign (=). For example:

```bash
my_name="Alice"
age=30
message="Hello there!"
```

In these examples, `my_name` holds the string "Alice", `age` holds the string "30", and `message` holds the string "Hello there!". Yes, even though age looks like a number, in Bash, it's treated as a string unless you explicitly perform arithmetic operations on it.

### Accessing Variable Values

To use the value stored in a variable, you need to precede the variable name with a dollar sign (`$`). This is called variable substitution. When Bash encounters `$variable_name`, it replaces it with the actual value of the variable. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
my_name="Bob"
echo "My name is $my_name" # This will output: My name is Bob
echo "My age is $age"       # This will output: My age is 30
```

(assuming you assigned it earlier)

You can also use curly braces `{}` around the variable name when you are embedding it within a larger string to avoid any ambiguity.
For example:

```bash
greeting="Hello"
name="Charlie"
echo "${greeting}, ${name}!" # This is often clearer than: echo "$greeting, $name!"
```

### Naming Conventions

While you have some freedom in naming your variables, it's good practice to follow certain conventions to make your scripts more readable:

- Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
- They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Avoid using spaces or special characters in variable names.
- Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable (e.g., `user_name` instead of just `n`).
- By convention, regular variable names are usually lowercase. Uppercase names are often reserved for environment variables (which we'll touch on later).

### Basic String Manipulation

One common operation is **concatenation**, which means joining two or more strings together. In Bash, you can do this simply by placing the variables or strings next to each other:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
first_name="John"
last_name="Doe"
full_name="${first_name}${last_name}" # Concatenating variables
echo "The full name is: $full_name"   # Output: The full name is: JohnDoe

greeting="Hello, "
user="World"
message="${greeting}${user}!"         # Another example
echo "$message"                       # Output: Hello, World!
```

Notice the use of curly braces `{}` again. While not always necessary for simple concatenation, they can be helpful when you have variable names directly next to other text that might be interpreted as part of the variable name.

### Quoting

Quoting is crucial when working with strings in Bash, especially when your strings contain spaces or special characters. There are three main types of quotes in Bash:

1. **Double Quotes (`"`)**: Double quotes allow for variable substitution and command substitution (which we'll learn about later). Most special characters within double quotes are treated literally, except for `` $ ``, `` ` ``, `` \ ``.

    ```bash
    name="Jane Smith"
    echo "Hello, $name!"      # Output: Hello, Jane Smith!
    echo "The current directory is: $(pwd)" # Command substitution within double quotes
    ```

2. **Single Quotes (`` ' ``)**: Single quotes treat everything inside them literally. No variable substitution or command substitution happens within single quotes.

    ```bash
    name="Jane Smith"
    echo 'Hello, $name!'      # Output: Hello, $name! (no substitution)
    echo 'The current directory is: $(pwd)' # No command substitution
    ```

3. **Backticks (`` ` ``)**: Backticks are used for command substitution (running a command and using its output as a string). However, the `$()` syntax is generally preferred for command substitution as it's more readable and handles nested commands better.

    ```bash
    current_dir=`pwd` # Command substitution (less preferred)
    echo "You are in: $current_dir"
    ```

Choosing the right type of quote depends on whether you want variable or command substitution to occur and whether your string contains special characters that need to be treated literally.

### Getting User Input with `read`

The read command is your primary tool for getting input directly from the user while a script is running. When your script encounters a `read` command, it will pause and wait for the user to type something into the terminal and press Enter. The text the user enters can then be stored in a variable.

Here's the basic syntax:

`read variable_name`

For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter your name:"
read user_name
echo "Hello, $user_name!"
```

In this script:

 1. `echo "Please enter your name:"` displays a message to the user.

 2. `read user_name` pauses the script and waits for the user to type their name and press Enter. The entered text is then stored in the variable `user_name`.

 3. `echo "Hello, $user_name!"` then uses the value stored in user_name to display a personalized greeting.

You can also provide a prompt directly within the `read` command using the `-p` option:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your favorite color: " favorite_color
echo "Your favorite color is: $favorite_color"
```

This does the same thing as the previous example but in a more concise way.

### Redirecting Output

So far, we've mainly used echo to send output to the standard output (your terminal screen). However, Bash provides ways to redirect the output of commands to other places, like files. Here are the main redirection operators:

- **`>` (Output Redirection)**: This operator redirects the output of a command to a file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.

    ```bash
    echo "This will be written to a file" > my_output.txt
    ls -l > file_list.txt  # Saves the long listing of files to file_list.txt
    ```

- **`>>` (Append Redirection)**: This operator also redirects output to a file, but instead of overwriting it, it appends the output to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

    ```bash
    echo "Adding more info" >> my_output.txt
    echo "Another line" >> file_list.txt
    ```

### Redirecting Input

Similarly, you can redirect the input of a command to come from a file instead of the keyboard using the `<` operator:

- **`<` (Input Redirection)**: This operator redirects the input of a command to come from a specified file.

    Let's say you have a file named names.txt with one name per line:

    Alice  
    Bob  
    Charlie  

    You could use `while read name < names.txt` to read each line of the file into the `name` variable within a loop (we'll learn about loops soon!). For now, just understand that `<` takes the input from the file.

Understanding how to get input from users and redirect the output of your scripts is fundamental for creating more interactive and useful automation tools.

## Control Flow

Let's get into making your scripts more intelligent with Control Flow. This allows your scripts to make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions.

### Conditional Statements

#### The `if` Statement

Let's begin learning conditional statements with the `if` statement. Think of it like saying, "IF this condition is true, THEN do this."

The basic structure of an if statement in Bash looks like this:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
  # Commands to execute if the condition is true
fi
```

Let's break it down:

- `if`: This keyword starts the conditional statement.

- `[ condition ]`: This is where you specify the condition to be evaluated. Notice the spaces around the square brackets! The `[` is actually a command itself (often linked to the test command), and the `]` is its closing argument.

- `then`: This keyword indicates the start of the block of code that will be executed if the condition is true.
  
- `#` **Commands to execute if the condition is true**: This is where you put the Bash commands you want to run when the condition is met.

- `fi`: This keyword marks the end of the if statement (it's "if" spelled backwards!).

##### Conditions

The crucial part is the **condition** inside the square brackets. These **conditions** often involve comparing values. Here are some common **comparison operators** you can use:

###### String Comparison Operators

- **String Comparisons**:
  - **`=` or `==`**: Checks if two strings are equal. (e.g., `[ "$name" = "Alice" ]`)
  - `!=`: Checks if two strings are not equal. (e.g., `[ "$name" != "Bob" ]`)
  - `-z string`: True if the length of `string` is zero (i.e., it's empty).
  - `-n string`: True if the length of `string` is non-zero (i.e., it's not empty).
  - `<`: True if `string1` sorts lexicographically before `string2`.
  - `>`: True if `string1` sorts lexicographically after `string2`.

    **Examples**:

    ```Bash
    #!/bin/bash

    STRING1="hello"
    STRING2="world"
    EMPTY_STRING=""

    if [ -z "$EMPTY_STRING" ]; then
      echo "The empty string is indeed empty."
    fi

    if [ -n "$STRING1" ]; then
      echo "$STRING1 is not an empty string."
    fi

    if [ "$STRING1" < "$STRING2" ]; then
      echo "$STRING1 comes before $STRING2 lexicographically."
    fi

    if [ "$STRING2" > "$STRING1" ]; then
      echo "$STRING2 comes after $STRING1 lexicographically."
    fi
    ```

###### Numeric Comparison Operators

- **Numeric Comparisons**: For comparing numbers, you should generally use specific numeric operators:
  - `-eq`: Equal to (e.g., `[ "$age" -eq 30 ]`)
  - `-ne`: Not equal to (e.g., `[ "$age" -ne 25 ]`)
  - `-gt`: Greater than (e.g., `[ "$count" -gt 10 ]`)
  - `-lt`: Less than (e.g., `[ "$count" -lt 5 ]`)
  - `-ge`: Greater than or equal to (e.g., `[ "$score" -ge 60 ]`)
  - `-le`: Less than or equal to (e.g., `[ "$score" -le 75 ]`)

    Example:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Enter your age:"
    read age

    if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
      echo "You are old enough to vote."
    fi

    echo "Thank you!"
    ```

    In this script, we ask for the user's age. The if condition `[ "$age" -ge 18 ]` checks if the value stored in the age variable is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, the message "You are old enough to vote." is displayed. Regardless of the age, the "Thank you!" message will always be shown because it's outside the if block.

    ---

    Bash also provides a more C-like syntax for arithmetic comparisons using double parentheses `(())`. Inside `(())`, you can use **standard arithmetic comparison operators**:

  - `==`: (equal to)
  - `!=`: (not equal to)
  - `>`: (greater than)
  - `>=`: (greater than or equal to)
  - `<`: (less than)
  - `<=`: (less than or equal to)

    **Examples using** `(())`:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    NUM1=10
    NUM2=20

    if (( NUM1 == 10 )); then
      echo "$NUM1 is equal to 10."
    fi

    if (( NUM1 < NUM2 )); then
      echo "$NUM1 is less than $NUM2."
    fi

    if (( NUM2 >= 20 )); then
      echo "$NUM2 is greater than or equal to 20."
    fi
    ```

    Using `(())` for arithmetic comparisons can often make your code cleaner and more familiar if you have programming experience

###### File Attribute Comparison Operators

- **File Attribute Comparisons**: Bash provides a set of operators that allow you to check various attributes of files and directories within your conditional statements. These are very useful for writing scripts that need to interact with the file system based on the existence, type, or properties of files.

  - `-e file`: True if `file` exists.
  - `-f file`: True if `file` exists and is a regular file (not a directory or other special file type).
  - `-d file`: True if file exists and is a directory.
  - `-s file`: True if `file` exists and has a size greater than zero (i.e., it's not empty).
  - `-r file`: True if `file` exists and is readable by the current user.
  - `-w file`: True if `file` exists and is writable by the current user.
  - `-x file`: True if `file` exists and is executable by the current user.
  - `-O file`: True if `file` exists and is owned by the current user.
  - `-G file`: True if `file` exists and belongs to the same group as the current user.
  - `-nt file1 file2`: True if `file1` is newer than `file2` (based on modification time).
  - `-ot file1 file2`: True if `file1` is older than `file2` (based on modification time).

    **Examples**:

    ```Bash
    #!/bin/bash

    FILE="my_data.txt"
    DIRECTORY="my_backup_folder"
    SCRIPT="my_script.sh"

    if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
      echo "$FILE exists."
    fi

    if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
      echo "$FILE is a regular file."
    fi

    if [ -d "$DIRECTORY" ]; then
      echo "$DIRECTORY is a directory."
    fi

    if [ -s "$FILE" ]; then
      echo "$FILE is not empty."
    else
      echo "$FILE is empty or does not exist."
    fi

    if [ -r "$FILE" ]; then
      echo "$FILE is readable."
    fi

    if [ -w "$FILE" ]; then
      echo "$FILE is writable."
    fi

    if [ -x "$SCRIPT" ]; then
      echo "$SCRIPT is executable."
    fi

    if [ -O "$FILE" ]; then
      echo "You are the owner of $FILE."
    fi

    if [ -G "$DIRECTORY" ]; then
      echo "$DIRECTORY belongs to your group."
    fi

    if [ "$FILE" -nt "$SCRIPT" ]; then
      echo "$FILE is newer than $SCRIPT."
    fi
    ```

#### The `else` Statement

The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the `if` condition is false. Its structure looks like this:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
  # Commands to execute if the condition is true
else
  # Commands to execute if the condition is false
fi
```

**Example**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read number

if [ "$number" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "The number you entered is greater than 10."
else
  echo "The number you entered is 10 or less."
fi
```

In this script, if the entered number is greater than 10, the first message is displayed. Otherwise (if it's 10 or less), the message in the `else` block is shown.

#### The `elif` Statement

The `elif` (short for "else if") statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. If the initial `if` condition is false, the `elif` condition is evaluated. If that's also false, the next `elif` (if any) is checked, and so on. Finally, an optional `else` block can be included at the end to handle cases where none of the preceding conditions are true.

The structure looks like this:

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
  # Commands to execute if condition1 is true
elif [ condition2 ]; then
  # Commands to execute if condition1 is false AND condition2 is true
elif [ condition3 ]; then
  # Commands to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false AND condition3 is true
else
  # Commands to execute if none of the above conditions are true
fi
```

**Example**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your grade (A, B, C, D, or F):"
read grade

if [ "$grade" = "A" ]; then
  echo "Excellent!"
elif [ "$grade" = "B" ]; then
  echo "Good job!"
elif [ "$grade" = "C" ]; then
  echo "Satisfactory."
elif [ "$grade" = "D" ]; then
  echo "Needs improvement."
else
  echo "Failing grade."
fi

echo "Thank you for your input."
```

In this script, we check the entered grade against several possibilities using `elif` statements. If none of the `elif` conditions are met (meaning the grade is not A, B, C, or D), the `else` block is executed.

These `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements provide you with powerful tools to create scripts that can react differently based on various inputs and conditions.

### Looping Structures

There are a few main types of loops in Bash: `for`, `while`, and `until`.

#### The `for` Loop

##### The `for` Loop (Iterating through a list)

The basic structure of a for loop that iterates through a list looks like this:

```bash
for variable in item1 item2 ... itemN; do
  # Commands to execute for each item
done
```

Let's break it down:

- `for variable in item1 item2 ... itemN`: This part defines the loop.
  - `variable`: This is a variable that will take on the value of each item in the list during each iteration of the loop.
  - `in item1 item2 ... itemN`: This specifies the list of items you want to loop through. The items are usually separated by spaces.
- `do`: This keyword marks the beginning of the block of commands that will be executed in each iteration.
- `# Commands to execute for each item`: Here you put the commands that you want to run for each item in the list. The current item can be accessed using the $variable.
- `done`: This keyword marks the end of the for loop.

Example:

```bash

#!/bin/bash
fruits="apple banana cherry"

for fruit in $fruits; do
  echo "I like $fruit"
done
```

In this script:

1. We define a variable `fruits` containing a list of fruit names separated by spaces.
2. The `for` loop iterates through each word in the `$fruits` variable.
3. In each iteration, the current fruit name is assigned to the `fruit` variable.
4. The `echo` command then prints "I like" followed by the current fruit.

The output of this script would be:

```shell
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
```

##### The `for` Loop (Iterating through a range)

You can also use for loops to iterate through a sequence of numbers using brace expansion:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "The current number is: $i"
done
```

This loop will iterate through the numbers 1 to 5 (inclusive), and the output will be:

```shell
The current number is: 1
The current number is: 2
The current number is: 3
The current number is: 4
The current number is: 5
```

##### The `for` Loop (Iterating with steps)

When you use brace expansion with two numbers like `{start..end}`, Bash assumes a step of 1. However, you can also specify a different step value using the syntax `{start..end..step}`.

For example, to iterate through even numbers from 2 to 10:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {2..10..2}; do
  echo "The current even number is: $i"
done
```

This will output:

```shell
The current even number is: 2
The current even number is: 4
The current even number is: 6
The current even number is: 8
The current even number is: 10
```

Similarly, you can count down:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {5..1..1}; do # Or simply {5..1} for a step of -1 (implied)
  echo "Counting down: $i"
done
```

Output:

```shell
Counting down: 5
Counting down: 4
Counting down: 3
Counting down: 2
Counting down: 1
```

##### The `for` Loop (Iterating through Characters)

Interestingly, you can also use brace expansion to iterate through a sequence of characters! This works similarly to numbers, based on their ASCII values.

To iterate through uppercase letters from A to D:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for char in {A..D}; do
  echo "The current letter is: $char"
done
```

Output:

```shell
The current letter is: A
The current letter is: B
The current letter is: C
The current letter is: D
```

You can do the same with lowercase letters:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for letter in {a..c}; do
  echo "The lowercase letter is: $letter"
done
```

Output:

```shell
The lowercase letter is: a
The lowercase letter is: b
The lowercase letter is: c
```

Keep in mind that the stepping with characters might not always produce intuitive results unless you're iterating through a contiguous block of the alphabet. For example, {A..Z..2} would give you A, C, E, and so on.

#### The `while` Loop

Think of a for loop as doing something a specific number of times or for each item in a list. A while loop, on the other hand, continues to execute a block of code **as long as a certain condition is true**.

The basic structure of a while loop looks like this:

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
  # Commands to execute as long as the condition is true
done
```

Let's break it down:

- `while [ condition ]`: This is the start of the loop. The `condition` inside the square brackets is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the commands inside the loop are executed. If it's false, the loop terminates, and the script moves on to the next command after `done`.
- `do`: Marks the beginning of the code block to be repeated.
- `# Commands to execute as long as the condition is true`: These are the commands that will be executed in each iteration of the loop, as long as the `condition` remains true.
- `done`: Marks the end of the `while` loop.

> **Important Note**: Inside the `while` loop, you need to make sure that something happens that will eventually make the `condition` false. If the condition never becomes false, you'll end up with an **infinite loop**, and your script will run forever (or until you manually stop it, usually by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal).

**Example**:

Let's create a script that counts down from 5 to 1:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=5

while [ "$count" -gt 0 ]; do
  echo "The count is: $count"
  count=$((count - 1)) # Decrement the count variable
done

echo "Blast off!"
```

In this script:

1. We initialize a variable `count` to 5.
2. The `while` loop continues as long as the value of `$count` is greater than 0 (`-gt 0`).
3. Inside the loop, we first print the current value of `count`.
4. Then, we use `$((count - 1))` to perform arithmetic subtraction and update the `count` variable by decrementing it by 1. This is crucial to eventually make the condition false.
5. Once `count` becomes 0, the condition `[ "$count" -gt 0 ]` becomes false, and the loop terminates.
6. Finally, "Blast off!" is printed.

#### The `until` Loop

The `until` loop is somewhat the opposite of the `while` loop. It continues to execute a block of code **as long as a certain condition is false**. The loop terminates when the condition becomes true.

The basic structure of an `until` loop looks like this:

```bash
until [ condition ]; do
  # Commands to execute as long as the condition is false
done
```

Let's break it down:

- `until [ condition ]`: This is the start of the loop. The `condition` inside the square brackets is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is false, the commands inside the loop are executed. If it's true, the loop terminates.
- `do`: Marks the beginning of the code block to be repeated.
- `# Commands to execute as long as the condition is false`: These are the commands that will be executed in each iteration of the loop, as long as the `condition` remains false.
- `done`: Marks the end of the `until` loop.

> Just like with `while` loops, it's crucial to ensure that something inside the `until` loop will eventually make the `condition` true, otherwise you'll run into an infinite loop!

Example:

Let's rewrite our countdown script using an `until` loop:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=1

until [ "$count" -gt 5 ]; do
  echo "The count is: $count"
  count=$((count + 1)) # Increment the count variable
done

echo "We reached 6!"
```

In this script:

1. We initialize a variable `count` to 1.
2. The `until` loop continues as long as the value of `$count` is not greater than 5 (`-gt 5` is false).
3. Inside the loop, we print the current value of `count`.
4. Then, we increment the `count` variable by 1. This will eventually make the condition true.
5. Once `count` becomes 6, the condition `[ "$count" -gt 5 ]` becomes true, and the loop terminates.
6. Finally, "We reached 6!" is printed.

Notice how the logic is slightly different from the `while` loop. The `until` loop keeps going until the condition is met.

### The `case` Statement

Think of a `case` statement as a more structured and often more readable alternative to a series of `if-elif-else` statements, especially when you're checking a single variable against multiple specific values.

The basic structure of a case statement looks like this:

```bash
case variable in
  pattern1)
    # Commands to execute if variable matches pattern1
    ;; # Note the double semicolon to terminate the case
  pattern2)
    # Commands to execute if variable matches pattern2
    ;;
  pattern3)
    # Commands to execute if variable matches pattern3
    ;;
  *) # Optional: Default case if no other pattern matches
    # Commands to execute if none of the above patterns match
    ;;
esac # Case spelled backwards marks the end of the statement
```

Let's break it down:

- `case variable in`: This starts the `case` statement and specifies the `variable` you want to test against different patterns.
- `pattern1), pattern2)`, etc.: These are the patterns you want to compare against the value of the `variable`. Patterns can be literal strings, wildcards (`*`, `?`, `[]`), or a combination of them.
- `# Commands to execute if variable matches pattern`: The commands listed here will be executed if the `variable` matches the corresponding `pattern`.
- `;;` **(Double Semicolon)**: This is crucial! It marks the end of the command block for a particular pattern. Once a match is found and the commands are executed, the `case` statement exits (it doesn't fall through to the next pattern).
- `*)` **(Wildcard)**: This is an optional "default" pattern. The asterisk `*` matches any string, so if none of the preceding patterns match the `variable`, the commands under `*)` will be executed. It's similar to the `else` in an `if-elif-else` structure.
- `esac`: This keyword (case spelled backwards) marks the end of the `case` statement.

Example:

Let's create a script that tells you what kind of pet you have based on your input:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "What kind of pet do you have (dog, cat, bird, fish)? "
read pet

case "$pet" in
  dog)
    echo "Woof! A loyal companion."
    ;;
  cat)
    echo "Meow! Independent and cuddly."
    ;;
  bird)
    echo "Chirp! A feathered friend."
    ;;
  fish)
    echo "Blub blub! A silent observer."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Hmm, I'm not familiar with that kind of pet."
    ;;
esac

echo "Thanks for telling me!"
```

In this script:

1. We ask the user for the type of pet they have and store it in the `pet` variable.
2. The `case` statement then checks the value of `$pet` against different patterns: "dog", "cat", "bird", and "fish".
3. If there's a match, the corresponding `echo` command is executed, and the `;;` terminates the `case` statement.
4. If the user enters something that doesn't match any of the specific patterns, the `*)` pattern is matched, and the default message is displayed.

## Functions

Think of a function as a mini-program within your main script. It's a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help you organize your scripts, make them more readable, and avoid repeating the same code in multiple places. It's like having your own custom commands!

### Defining a Function

There are two main ways to define a function in Bash:

#### Using the `function` keyword

**Method 1**: Using the function keyword:

```bash
function function_name {
  # Commands to be executed inside the function
}
```

#### Using the `function` name followed by parantheses

**Method 2**: Using just the function name followed by parentheses:

```bash
function_name () {
  # Commands to be executed inside the function
}
```

Both methods achieve the same result. Choose the one you find more readable or stick to a consistent style in your scripts.

- `function_name`: This is the name you give to your function. It should be descriptive of what the function does. Follow similar naming conventions as for variables (start with a letter or underscore, can contain letters, numbers, and underscores).
- `{ ... }`: The curly braces enclose the block of code that will be executed when the function is called.

### Calling a Function

To execute the code inside a function, you simply use its name as if it were a regular Bash command:

```bash
function greet {
  echo "Hello from the greet function!"
}

# Call the function:
greet
```

When you run this script, it will output:

```shell
Hello from the greet function!
```

Functions should be defined in your script before they are called. It's common practice to place function definitions at the beginning of your script.

**Example with a bit more action**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function print_report {
  echo "--------------------"
  echo "     Report Start     "
  echo "--------------------"
  echo "Processing complete."
  echo "--------------------"
}

echo "Starting the main part of the script..."
print_report # Calling the function
echo "Main script continues..."
print_report # Calling the function again
```

This example shows how you can define a function print_report that displays a formatted message and then call it multiple times within your script, reusing the same block of code.

### Passing Arguments to Functions

Just like you can pass arguments to regular Bash commands (like `ls -l` where `-l` is an argument), you can also pass values to your own functions. These values are then accessible within the function as special variables.

When you call a function with arguments, the arguments are separated by spaces, just like with regular commands. Inside the function, these arguments are accessed using positional parameters:

- `$1`: Represents the first argument passed to the function.
- `$2`: Represents the second argument.
- `$3`: Represents the third argument, and so on.
- `$#`: Contains the total number of arguments passed to the function.
- `$*`: Contains all the arguments as a single string, separated by spaces.
- `$@`: Contains all the arguments as separate words (this is generally safer to use than `$*` when you need to iterate through arguments).

**Example**:

Let's create a function that greets a specific name:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function greet_name {
  local name="$1" # It's good practice to assign arguments to local variables
  echo "Hello, $name!"
}

greet_name "Alice"  # Calling the function with "Alice" as the first argument
greet_name "Bob"    # Calling it again with "Bob"
```

In this script:

1. We define a function `greet_name`.
2. Inside the function, `$1` holds the first argument passed to it. We assign this to a local variable `name` (we'll talk about `local` variables in a bit).
3. The function then prints a greeting using the provided name.
4. We call `greet_name` twice, each time passing a different name as an argument.

The output would be:

```shell
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
```

**Another Example with Multiple Arguments**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function describe_pet {
  local animal="$1"
  local color="$2"
  echo "You have a $color $animal."
}

describe_pet "cat" "black"   # First argument is "cat", second is "black"
describe_pet "dog" "brown"   # First is "dog", second is "brown"
```

**Output**:

```shell
You have a black cat.
You have a brown dog.
```

Using arguments makes your functions much more versatile because they can operate on different data each time they are called.

#### Processing Function Arguments with `$#`, `$*`, and `$@`

It's important to understand how `$#`, `$*`, and `$@` work with function parameters. Let's extend our previous example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function process_arguments {
  echo "Number of arguments: $#"
  echo "All arguments as a single string ($*): $*"
  echo "All arguments as separate words ($@): $@"

  echo "Iterating through arguments using \$@:"
  for arg in "$@"; do
    echo "  Argument: $arg"
  done

  echo "Iterating through arguments using \$*:"
  for arg in $*; do
    echo "  Argument: $arg"
  done
}

process_arguments "apple" "banana" "cherry"
process_arguments "one two" "three"
```

Let's break down what happens when we run this:

**First call**: `process_arguments "apple" "banana" "cherry"`

- `$#` inside the function will be `3` (there are three arguments).
- `$*` will be `"apple banana cherry"` (all arguments joined into one space-separated string).
- `$@` will be `"apple" "banana" "cherry"` (each argument treated as a separate word, even if it contains spaces).

The output for the first call will be:

```shell
Number of arguments: 3
All arguments as a single string ($*): apple banana cherry
All arguments as separate words ($@): apple banana cherry
Iterating through arguments using $@:
  Argument: apple
  Argument: banana
  Argument: cherry
Iterating through arguments using $*:
  Argument: apple
  Argument: banana
  Argument: cherry
```

**Second call**: `process_arguments "one two" "three"`

- `$#` will be `2` (there are two arguments).
- `$*` will be `"one two three"` (all joined into one string).
- `$@` will be `"one two"` `"three"` (notice how "one two" is treated as a single argument because it was quoted in the function call).

The output for the second call will be:

```shell
Number of arguments: 2
All arguments as a single string ($*): one two three
All arguments as separate words ($@): one two three
Iterating through arguments using $@:
  Argument: one two
  Argument: three
Iterating through arguments using $*:
  Argument: one
  Argument: two
  Argument: three
```

- `$*` treats all arguments as a single string. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior when iterating, especially if arguments contain spaces.
- `$@` is generally safer to use when you need to iterate through the arguments, as it preserves the individual arguments even if they contain spaces (as long as they were quoted when the function was called).

It's a good practice to use `$@` within your functions when you intend to loop through the arguments to ensure each argument is handled correctly.

### Local Variables in Functions

When you declare a variable inside a Bash function, by default, it has global scope. This means it can be accessed and modified from anywhere in your script, even outside the function. While this can sometimes be useful, it can also lead to unintended side effects and make your code harder to manage, especially in larger scripts.

To limit the scope of a variable to the function in which it's defined, you use the `local` keyword. When you declare a variable with `local`, it becomes a **local variable**. This means:

- **Scope**: It is only accessible within the function where it is defined.
- **Lifetime**: It exists only while the function is being executed. Once the function finishes, the local variable is destroyed.
- **Name Shadowing**: If a local variable has the same name as a global variable, the local variable will "shadow" or hide the global variable within the function. Any changes made to the local variable will not affect the global variable.

**Example**:

```Bash
#!/bin/bash

GLOBAL_VAR="I am global"

my_function() {
  local LOCAL_VAR="I am local to the function"
  echo "Inside the function:"
  echo "  Global variable: $GLOBAL_VAR"
  echo "  Local variable: $LOCAL_VAR"
  GLOBAL_VAR="Global variable modified inside function"
  LOCAL_VAR="Local variable modified inside function"
  echo "  Global variable after modification: $GLOBAL_VAR"
  echo "  Local variable after modification: $LOCAL_VAR"
}

echo "Before calling the function:"
echo "  Global variable: $GLOBAL_VAR"
# Trying to access LOCAL_VAR here will result in an empty string or an error

my_function

echo "After calling the function:"
echo "  Global variable: $GLOBAL_VAR" # The global variable has been modified
# LOCAL_VAR no longer exists here
```

In this example:

1. `GLOBAL_VAR` is defined outside the function, making it a global variable.
2. Inside `my_function`, `LOCAL_VAR` is declared using local. It can only be accessed within `my_function`.
3. When `my_function` modifies both `GLOBAL_VAR` and `LOCAL_VAR`, the changes to `LOCAL_VAR` are confined to the function. The global `GLOBAL_VAR`, however, is indeed changed.
4. Outside the function, we can see the modified global variable, but we cannot access `LOCAL_VAR`.

**Why use** `local`**?**

- **Preventing Side Effects**: Using `local` helps ensure that your functions don't accidentally modify global variables in unexpected ways, making your code more predictable.
- **Code Clarity**: It makes it clearer which variables are intended for internal use within a function, improving the readability and maintainability of your scripts.
- **Avoiding Naming Conflicts**: If you use the same variable name in different functions, declaring them as `local` prevents them from interfering with each other or with global variables.

It's generally a good practice to declare any variables that are only needed within a function as `local`.

### Returning Values from Functions

There are a couple of common ways for a Bash function to "return" a value:

1. **Using `echo` and Command Substitution**:

    The most straightforward way is for a function to echo the value you want to return to the standard output. Then, when you call the function, you can capture this output using command substitution (using $() or backticks `).

    **Example**:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    function add_numbers {
      local num1="$1"
      local num2="$2"
      local sum=$((num1 + num2))
      echo "$sum" # The function "returns" the sum by echoing it
    }

    result=$(add_numbers 5 3) # Capture the output of the function into the 'result' variable
    echo "The sum is: $result"
    
    another_result=`add_numbers 10 7` # Using backticks for command substitution
    echo "Another sum is: $another_result"
    ```

    In this script:

    1. The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments, calculates their sum, and then uses `echo` to send the result to the standard output.
    2. When we call `add_numbers 5 3`, the output "8" is captured by `$()` and stored in the `result` variable.
    3. Similarly, when we call `add_numbers 10 7`, the output "17" is captured by backticks and stored in `another_result`.
    4. Finally, we print the captured results.

2. **Using the `return` Statement (for Exit Status)**:

    The `return` statement in Bash functions is primarily used to indicate the exit status of the function. The exit status is an integer between 0 and 255, where 0 typically indicates success, and any non-zero value indicates an error or some other specific outcome.

    While you *can* technically use `return` to pass small integer values back, it's not the standard way to return general data like strings or larger numbers. The exit status is more useful for signaling success or failure to other parts of your script or to other programs.

    You can access the exit status of the last executed command (including a function call) using the special variable `$?`.

    **Example using `return` for exit status**:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    function check_value {
      local num="$1"
      if [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; then
        echo "Value is greater than 10."
        return 0 # Indicate success
      else
        echo "Value is 10 or less."
        return 1 # Indicate failure \(in this context, meaning not greater than 10\)
      fi
    }

    check_value 15
    if [ "$?" -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "The function reported success."
    else
      echo "The function reported failure."
    fi

    check_value 7
    if [ "$?" -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "The function reported success."
    else
      echo "The function reported failure."
    fi
    ```

    In this example, the `check_value` function uses `return` to signal whether the input number is greater than 10 or not. The main part of the script then checks the exit status `$?` to take different actions.

- For returning general data (strings, numbers), use `echo` within the function and capture its output using command substitution (`$()` or `` ` ``).
- Use the `return` statement primarily to indicate the success or failure (exit status) of the function.

## Working with Files and Directories

Being able to manipulate files and directories from the command line is a core skill for automation.

### File Operations

- `touch`: This command is primarily used to create new, empty files. If the file already exists, it updates its timestamp (the last time it was accessed or modified).

    ```bash
    touch my_new_file.txt  # Creates an empty file named 'my_new_file.txt'
    touch another_file.log # Creates 'another_file.log'
    ```

- `cp`: This command is used to **copy** files and directories. The basic syntax is `cp source destination`.

    ```bash
    cp file1.txt file1_backup.txt  # Creates a copy of 'file1.txt' named 'file1_backup.txt' in the same directory
    cp report.pdf documents/report_copy.pdf # Copies 'report.pdf' to the 'documents' directory with a new name
    ```

    To copy directories and their contents recursively, you need to use the `-r` or `-R` option:

    ```bash
    cp -r my_folder my_folder_backup # Creates a copy of the 'my_folder' directory and everything inside it
    ```

- `mv`: This command is used to **move** or **rename** files and directories. The syntax is `mv source destination`.

    ```bash
    mv old_file.txt new_file.txt      # Renames 'old_file.txt' to 'new_file.txt' in the same directory
    mv data.csv archive/data.csv      # Moves 'data.csv' into the 'archive' directory
    mv logs/error.log .               # Moves 'error.log' from the 'logs' directory to the current directory (.)
    ```

- `rm`: This command is used to **remove** (delete) files and directories. **Be very careful with this command, as deleted files are usually gone for good!**

    ```bash
    rm unwanted_file.tmp        # Deletes 'unwanted_file.tmp'
    rm *.log                   # Deletes all files ending with '.log' in the current directory
    ```

    To remove directories and their contents recursively, you need to use the `-r` or `-R` option. **Use this with extreme caution!**

    ```bash
    rm -r old_directory         # Deletes 'old_directory' and everything inside it
    ```

    You can also use the `-f` option to force the removal without prompting (if you have write permissions). However, be extra careful with `-rf`!

### Directory Operations

Just like files, you'll often need to create, navigate, and remove directories in your scripts.

Here are some essential commands for working with directories:

- `mkdir`: This command is used to **create** directories.

    ```bash
    mkdir my_new_directory     # Creates a directory named 'my_new_directory' in the current location
    mkdir -p path/to/new_directory # Creates the entire directory path, including parent directories if they don't exist (using the -p option)
    ```

- `cd`: We've already encountered this one! It stands for**change directory** and is used to **navigate** between directories.

    ```bash
    cd documents              # Changes the current directory to the 'documents' directory (must be within the current path or specified with a full path)
    cd ..                   # Moves one level up in the directory hierarchy (to the parent directory)
    cd ~                    # Returns you to your home directory
    cd /path/to/another/directory # Changes to the specified absolute path
    ```

- `rmdir`: This command is used to `remove` empty directories. It will only work if the directory is completely empty.

    ```Bash
    rmdir empty_folder         # Removes the 'empty_folder' directory (if it's empty)
    ```

- `rm -r` **(again, with caution!)**: As we mentioned with file removal, the `rm -r` command can also be used to remove directories and all of their contents (files and subdirectories). **Use this command with extreme caution!**

    ```bash
    rm -r unwanted_directory  # Deletes 'unwanted_directory' and everything inside it
    ```

Understanding these commands allows your scripts to organize files, navigate the file system to find specific resources, and clean up temporary directories.

### Permissions

In Linux and macOS (which Bash often runs on), every file and directory has associated permissions that determine who can read, write, and execute them. Understanding these permissions is crucial for security and for ensuring your scripts can run correctly.

Permissions are typically represented in two ways: symbolically (like `rwxr-xr--`) and numerically (like `755`). Let's focus on the symbolic representation first.

For each file or directory, there are three categories of users who can have different permissions:

- **u (user)**: The owner of the file or directory.
- **g (group)**: The group that the file or directory belongs to.
- **o (others)**: All other users on the system.

For each of these categories, there are three types of permissions:

- **r (read)**: Allows you to open and read the contents of a file, or list the contents of a directory.
- **w (write)**: Allows you to modify the contents of a file, or create, delete, and rename files within a directory.
- **x (execute)**: For files, this allows you to run the file as a program or script. For directories, this allows you to access the directory (i.e., `cd` into it) and access the files and subdirectories within it.

When you list files and directories using ls -l, you'll see a string of characters at the beginning of each line that represents the permissions. For example:

```shell
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 May  7 20:00 my_file.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 May  7 20:05 my_directory
```

The first character indicates the file type (`-` for regular file, `d` for directory, etc.). The next nine characters represent the permissions in three sets of three: user, group, and others, in that order.

- `-rw-r--r--`:
  - **user (rw-)**: The owner has read and write permissions but cannot execute it.
  - **group (r--)**: Members of the group have read-only permission.
  - **others (r--)**: All other users have read-only permission.

- `drwxr-xr-x`:
  - **user (rwx)**: The owner has read, write, and execute permissions (for a directory, execute means the ability to enter it).
  - **group (r-x)**: Members of the group have read and execute permissions.
  - **others (r-x)**: All other users have read and execute permissions.

#### Modifying Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` (change mode) command is used to modify the permissions of files and directories. You can do this in two ways: symbolically or numerically.

**Symbolic Mode**:

You specify which user category (`u`, `g`, `o`, `a` for all) and which operation (`+` to add, `-` to remove, `=` to set) you want to perform on which permission (`r`, `w`, `x`).

```Bash
chmod u+x my_script.sh       # Add execute permission for the owner
chmod g-w my_document.txt    # Remove write permission for the group
chmod o=r my_image.jpg       # Set read-only permission for others
chmod a+rwx my_folder        # Add read, write, and execute for all (user, group, others)
```

**Numeric Mode**:

Each permission (read, write, execute) can also be represented by a number:

- `r` = 4
- `w` = 2
- `x` = 1
- no permission = 0

To set permissions numerically, you provide a three-digit number (one digit for user, one for group, and one for others). Each digit is the sum of the permissions for that category.

For example, 755 means:

- **user (7)**: `4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute)`
- **group (5)**: `4 (read) + 0 (write) + 1 (execute)`
- **others (5)**: `4 (read) + 0 (write) + 1 (execute)`

So, to set these permissions on a file or directory:

```bash
chmod 755 my_script.sh
chmod 644 my_document.txt  # Owner: read/write (6), Group: read-only (4), Others: read-only (4)
```

Understanding and using `chmod` is essential for controlling access to your files and making your scripts executable.

### Text Manipulation

This will cover how to work with the **content** of files.

#### Using `cat` and `less`

We'll start with some basic tools for viewing file content: `cat` and `less`.

- `cat`: This command is short for "concatenate" and is primarily used to display the entire content of one or more files to the standard output (your terminal screen). It's useful for quickly viewing small files.

    ```Bash
    cat my_document.txt        # Displays the entire content of 'my_document.txt'
    cat file1.txt file2.txt    # Displays the content of 'file1.txt' followed by the content of 'file2.txt'
    cat report.csv | head       # Displays the beginning of 'report.csv' (we'll learn about pipes '|' later)
    ```

    Be cautious when using cat on very large files, as it will dump the entire content to your screen at once, which can be overwhelming.

- `less`: This command is a more sophisticated pager program for viewing file content. It allows you to navigate through the file content page by page (or screen by screen). This is much more suitable for viewing large files.

    ```Bash
    less big_log_file.log      # Opens 'big_log_file.log' in the less pager
    ```

    While `less` is running, you can use various commands to navigate:

  - **Spacebar**: Move to the next page.
  - **b**: Move to the previous page.
  - **j**: Move down one line.
  - **k**: Move up one line.
  - **/pattern**: Search for the next occurrence of 'pattern'. Press n to go to the next match and N to go to the previous match.
  - **q**: Quit less.

These two commands, `cat` for quick views of small files and `less` for navigating larger ones, are essential for inspecting the data you'll be working with in your scripts.

#### Using `grep`

Let's learn how to find specific information within that content using the powerful command-line tool `grep`.

`grep` stands for "global regular expression print". It's used to search for lines in input files that match a given pattern. The basic syntax is:

```bash
grep [options] pattern [file...]
```

- `pattern`: This is the text or a regular expression (we'll touch on those later) that you want to search for.
- `[file...]`: This is the name of one or more files you want to search within. If no files are specified, `grep` reads from the standard input (e.g., the output of another command piped to `grep`).
- `[options]`: These are flags that modify how grep works. Some common options include:
  - `-i`: Ignore case (so "hello", "Hello", and "HELLO" will all match).
  - `-n`: Display the line number of each matching line.
  - `-v`: Invert the match – only show lines that do not contain the pattern.
  - `-c`: Display only a count of the matching lines, not the lines themselves.
  - `-r` or `-R`: Recursively search through directories and their subdirectories.
  - `-w`: Match whole words only. For example, searching for "the" with `-w` will not match "there".

**Basic Examples**:

```bash
grep "error" logfile.txt        # Find all lines containing "error" in 'logfile.txt'
grep -i "warning" system.log     # Find all lines containing "warning" (case-insensitive) in 'system.log'
grep -n "important" notes.md    # Find all lines with "important" in 'notes.md' and show their line numbers
grep -v "debug" output.log       # Show all lines in 'output.log' that do *not* contain "debug"
grep -c "success" install.log    # Count the number of lines containing "success" in 'install.log'
grep -r "config" /etc/           # Recursively search for "config" in all files under the '/etc/' directory
grep -w "bash" my_script.sh      # Find lines where "bash" is a whole word in 'my_script.sh'
```

`grep` is an incredibly versatile tool for filtering and finding specific information within text data, which is a common task in scripting and system administration.

#### Using `sed`

`sed` stands for "stream editor". It's a powerful command-line utility that allows you to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (like a file or the output of another command). Unlike text editors you might be familiar with, `sed` processes the text line by line and doesn't usually modify the original file directly (unless you explicitly tell it to). Instead, it outputs the modified text to the standard output.

The basic syntax of `sed` is:

```bash
sed [options] 'command' [file...]
```

- `[options]`: These modify `sed`'s behavior. A common option is `-i` which allows you to edit the file "in-place" (be careful with this!).
- `'command'`: This specifies the operation you want `sed` to perform. `sed` commands often involve an address (specifying which lines to operate on) and an action.
- `[file...]`: The file(s) you want to process. If no file is given, `sed` reads from standard input.

**Common `sed` Commands**:

Here are a few fundamental `sed` commands:

- `s/old/new/` **(Substitute)**: This is one of the most frequently used commands. It replaces the first occurrence of `old` with `new` on each line that matches the address (if provided). You can add flags after the last `/`:
  - `g`: Replace all occurrences on the line (global).
  - `i`: Ignore case.
  - `1`, `2`, etc.: Replace only the nth occurrence.

    ```bash
    echo "This is a test string" | sed 's/test/example/'  # Output: This is a example string
    echo "word word word" | sed 's/word/replaced/g'     # Output: replaced replaced replaced
    echo "HELLO world" | sed 's/hello/goodbye/i'        # Output: goodbye world
    sed 's/old_text/new_text/' input.txt > output.txt   # Replace in a file and save to a new file
    sed -i 's/mistake/correction/g' myfile.txt        # Replace in-place in 'myfile.txt' (CAUTION!)
    ```

- `p` **(Print)**: Prints the current line. Often used in conjunction with `-n` (suppress default output) to print only the lines that match a certain pattern.

    ```bash
    sed -n '/pattern/p' input.txt  # Print only lines containing "pattern"
    ```

- `d` **(Delete)**: Deletes the current line.

    ```bash
    sed '/unwanted_line/d' input.txt # Delete lines containing "unwanted_line"
    sed '5d' input.txt              # Delete the 5th line
    sed '1,3d' input.txt            # Delete lines 1 through 3
    ```

- Addresses: You can specify which lines `sed` should operate on:
  - No address: Apply the command to all lines.
  - Number: Apply to a specific line number (e.g., `5s/old/new/`).
  - `/pattern/`: Apply to lines matching a regular expression (e.g., `/error/d`).
  - `start,end`: Apply to a range of lines (e.g., `10,20d`)`.

`sed` is a powerful tool for automating text editing tasks, like replacing patterns, deleting lines, or extracting specific information from files.

#### Using `awk`

`awk` is more than just a text editor or a search tool; it's a full-fledged programming language designed for processing text data, especially data organized in rows and columns (like CSV files or log files). `awk` reads input line by line and then splits each line into fields based on a defined delimiter (whitespace is the default). You can then perform actions on these fields.

The basic syntax of `awk` is:

```bash
awk '[options] { action }' [file...]
awk '[options] pattern { action }' [file...]
```

- `[options]`: These modify `awk`'s behavior. A common option is `-F` to specify a different field delimiter.
- `pattern` **(optional)**: A condition that, if met for a line, will cause the associated `action` to be executed. If no pattern is provided, the action is executed for every line.
- `{ action }`: The set of commands to be executed for each line that matches the pattern (or every line if no pattern is given). Actions are enclosed in curly braces.
- `[file...]`: The input file(s). If no file is specified, `awk` reads from standard input.

**Key Concepts in** `awk`:

- **Records**: Each line in the input is considered a record.
- **Fields**: Within each record, the text is split into fields. By default, fields are separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs). `awk` assigns field variables: `$0` represents the entire line (record), `$1` represents the first field, `$2` the second, and so on.
- **Patterns**: Conditions you can use to select which records to process (e.g., lines containing a specific string, or lines where a certain field matches a condition).
- **Actions**: Commands you want to perform on the selected records (e.g., print fields, perform calculations, format output).

**Basic Examples**:

Let's say you have a file named `data.csv` with the following content (comma-separated):

```shell
Name,Age,City
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
```

Here are some basic awk commands:

- **Print all lines**:

    ```bash
    awk '{ print }' data.csv
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    Name,Age,City
    Alice,30,New York
    Bob,25,Los Angeles
    Charlie,35,Chicago
    ```

- **Print the first field (**`$1`**) of each line (using comma as a delimiter)**:

    ```Bash
    awk -F',' '{ print $1 }' data.csv
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    Name
    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie
    ```

- **Print the name and city (first and third fields)**:

    ```bash
    awk -F',' '{ print $1, $3 }' data.csv
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    Name City
    Alice New York
    Bob Los Angeles
    Charlie Chicago
    ```

- **Print lines where the age (second field) is greater than 28**:

    ```bash
    awk -F',' '$2 > 28 { print }' data.csv
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    Alice,30,New York
    Charlie,35,Chicago
    ```

`awk` is incredibly powerful for tasks like extracting data from logs, reformatting text files, performing calculations on columns of data, and much more. It's a tool that's well worth mastering for advanced Bash scripting.

## Advanced Topics

### Arrays

Think of an **array** as a way to store multiple values under a single variable name. It's like having a list of items that you can easily access and manipulate. Arrays are incredibly useful for organizing and processing collections of data.

#### Defining Arrays

There are a couple of ways to define arrays in Bash:

1. **Using Parentheses**: You can list the elements of the array within parentheses, separated by spaces:

    ```Bash
    my_array=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
    numbers=(10 20 30 40 50)
    ```

2. **Using Indexed Assignment**: You can assign values to specific indices (positions) in the array:

    ```bash
    my_array[0]="apple"
    my_array[1]="banana"
    my_array[2]="cherry"
    ```

    Bash arrays are **zero-indexed**, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. You don't have to assign values to indices sequentially; you can even have "sparse" arrays with gaps in the indices.

#### Accessing Array Elements

To access a specific element in an array, you use the variable name followed by the index in curly braces preceded by a dollar sign:

```Bash
echo "${my_array[0]}"  # Output: apple
echo "${numbers[2]}"    # Output: 30
```

Using curly braces `${}` around the array element is generally recommended to avoid potential issues with variable expansion, especially when the index is more complex.

#### Special Array Variables

Bash provides some special variables for working with arrays:

- `${#my_array[@]}` **or** `${#my_array[*]}`: These give you the number of elements in the array.
- `${my_array[@]}` **or** `${my_array[*]}`: These expand to all elements of the array. When used with double quotes (`"${my_array[@]}"`), each element is treated as a separate word. When used without quotes or with single quotes (`'${my_array[@]}'`), the elements are joined by the first character of the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) environment variable (usually a space). `${my_array[*]}` behaves similarly but joins with spaces even within double quotes. It's generally safer to use `"${my_array[@]}"` when you need to iterate over the array elements.

**Example**:

```Bash
#!/bin/bash
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry" "date")

echo "Number of fruits: ${#fruits[@]}"

echo "All fruits: ${fruits[@]}"

echo "First fruit: ${fruits[0]}"
echo "Third fruit: ${fruits[2]}"

echo "Iterating through fruits:"
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "I like $fruit"
done
```

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that allows you to handle collections of items efficiently in your Bash scripts.

### Regular Expressions

Let's step into the world of **Regular Expressions** (often shortened to "regex"). This is a powerful tool for describing and matching patterns in text. Think of them as supercharged wildcards!

Regular expressions are used by many text processing tools (like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and even some programming languages) to perform sophisticated searches and substitutions. Mastering the basics of regex will significantly enhance your ability to manipulate text with Bash.

Here are some fundamental building blocks of regular expressions:

- **Literal Characters**: Most characters in a regex match themselves literally. For example, the regex `cat` will match the string "cat" in a text.
- **Metacharacters**: These are special characters that have a specific meaning in regex. Here are a few important ones:
  - `.`: Matches any single character (except a newline character by default). For example, `c.t` will match "cat", "cot", "cut", "c!t", etc.
  - `*`: Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, `ca*t` will match "ct", "cat", "caat", "caaat", and so on.
  - `+`: Matches the preceding element one or more times. For example, `ca+t` will match "cat", "caat", "caaat", but not "ct".
  - `?`: Matches the preceding element zero or one time (it's optional). For example, `ca?t` will match "ct" and "cat", but not "caat".
  - `[]`: Defines a character set. It matches any single character within the brackets.
    - `[abc]`: Matches "a", "b", or "c".
    - `[a-z]`: Matches any lowercase letter from "a" to "z".
    - `[0-9]`: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
    - `[^abc]`: Matches any character not in the set (negated set).
  - `^`: Matches the beginning of a line (when used outside of `[]`).
  - `$`: Matches the end of a line.
  - `()`: Groups parts of the regex together. This is often used with other metacharacters to apply them to the entire group. For example, `(ab)*` matches zero or more occurrences of "ab".
  - `|`: Acts as an "OR" operator. For example, `cat|dog` will match either "cat" or "dog".
  - `\`: The escape character. Used to treat a metacharacter as a literal character. For example, to match a literal dot, you would use `\.`.

**Examples using** `grep` **with Regular Expressions**:

To use regular expressions with `grep`, you often need to use the `-E` option (for extended regular expressions) or simply `egrep` (which is equivalent to `grep -E`). Basic `grep` also supports some regex features, but `-E` gives you more power.

```bash
grep "^hello" myfile.txt      # Find lines that start with "hello"
grep "world$" myfile.txt      # Find lines that end with "world"
grep "[0-9]+" logfile.log     # Find lines containing one or more digits
grep "user[1-5]" data.txt     # Find lines containing "user" followed by a digit from 1 to 5
grep "a.*b" text.txt          # Find lines containing "a", followed by zero or more characters, followed by "b"
grep -E "(cat|dog) food" pets.txt # Find lines containing either "cat food" or "dog food"
```

Regular expressions can seem a bit daunting at first, but with practice, they become an invaluable tool for pattern matching in text.

### Process Management

Now, let's talk about **Process Management** in Bash. This is about how you can control the execution of commands and scripts, especially when you want to run things in the background or manage running jobs.

Here are a few key concepts and tools for process management:

- **Running in the Background (**`&`**)**: You can run a command or a script in the background by adding an ampersand (`&`) at the end of the command. This allows the command to execute without tying up your terminal, and you can continue to use the terminal for other tasks.

    ```Bash
    ./long_running_script.sh &
    sleep 60 &
    ```

    When you run a command in the background, Bash will typically display a job number and a process ID (PID) for that process.

- **Job Control (**`jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`**)**: When you run commands in the background or suspend them, Bash keeps track of them as "jobs." You can manage these jobs using specific commands:

  - `jobs`: This command displays a list of the currently running and stopped jobs, along with their job numbers.

    ```bash
    jobs
    ```

- `fg` **(Foreground)**: This command brings a background job to the foreground, allowing you to interact with it directly in your terminal. You can specify the job number (e.g., `fg %1`) or simply use `fg` to bring the most recently backgrounded or stopped job to the foreground.

    ```bash
    fg %1
    fg
    ```

- `bg` **(Background)**: This command resumes a stopped job in the background. You need to specify the job number (e.g., `bg %2`).

    ```bash
    bg %2
    ```

- `kill`: This command is used to send signals to processes. The most common signal is `SIGTERM` (terminate), which asks the process to exit gracefully. You usually need to specify the process ID (PID) of the process you want to kill. You can find the PID using the `ps` command (which lists running processes) or sometimes with the `jobs` command.

    ```Bash
    ps aux | grep long_running_script.sh # Find the PID
    kill 12345                         # Send SIGTERM to process with PID 12345
    kill -9 12345                      # Forcefully kill the process (SIGKILL) - use this as a last resort!
    kill %1                            # Send SIGTERM to job number 1
    ```

**Example Scenario**:

Let's say you start a long-running backup script in the background:

```bash
./backup.sh &
[1] 12345
```

This tells you that the script is job number 1 and its process ID is 12345. You can continue using your terminal. If you want to check on its status, you can run:

```bash
jobs
[1]+ Running                 ./backup.sh &
```

If you decide you need to interact with the script directly, you can bring it to the foreground:

```bash
fg %1
```

And if you need to stop it (try gracefully first):

```bash
kill %1
```

Or more forcefully if it's not responding:

```bash
kill -9 %1
```

Understanding process management allows you to run multiple tasks concurrently, manage long-running scripts, and control the execution of commands in your Bash environment.

### Scripting for Automation

Now, let's make it really tangible by looking at **Scripting for Automation**. This is where you'll see how all these individual pieces can come together to perform useful, real-world tasks.

Here are a few examples of common automation tasks that you can achieve with Bash scripts:

1. Backing up files:

    You could write a script that:

    - Takes a source directory and a destination directory as arguments.
    - Uses `cp -r` to recursively copy the contents of the source to the destination.
    - Optionally, it could use `tar` and `gzip` to create a compressed archive for more efficient backup.
    - It could even be scheduled to run automatically using `cron` (a time-based job scheduler on Unix-like systems).

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    SOURCE="$1"
    DESTINATION="$2"

    if [ -z "$SOURCE" ] || [ -z "$DESTINATION" ]; then
      echo "Usage: $0 <source_directory> <destination_directory>"
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "Starting backup from $SOURCE to $DESTINATION..."
    cp -r "$SOURCE" "$DESTINATION"
    echo "Backup complete."
    ```

2. Log file analysis:

    You could write a script to:

    - Take a log file as input.
    - Use `grep` to find specific patterns (e.g., "error", "failed login").
    - Use `awk` to extract relevant information (e.g., timestamps, user IPs).
    - Use `sed` to reformat the output.
    - Generate a summary report or send notifications based on the analysis.

    ```Bash
    #!/bin/bash
    LOG_FILE="$1"
    SEARCH_TERM="error"

    if [ -z "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
      echo "Usage: $0 <log_file>"
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "Searching for '$SEARCH_TERM' in $LOG_FILE..."
    grep "$SEARCH_TERM" "$LOG_FILE"
    ```

3. System monitoring:

    A script could:

    - Use commands like `df -h` (disk space), `free -m` (memory usage), `uptime` (system load), to gather system information.
    - Use conditional statements to check if certain thresholds are exceeded (e.g., disk space is low).
    - Send alerts (e.g., via email using mail) if issues are detected.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    DISK_THRESHOLD=90 # Percentage

    USAGE=$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')

    if [ "$USAGE" -gt "$DISK_THRESHOLD" ]; then
      echo "Warning: Disk usage on / is above $DISK_THRESHOLD% ($USAGE%)."
      # You could add code here to send an email or log the warning
    fi
    ```

4. Automating software deployment:

    More advanced scripts can be used to:

    - Fetch code from a repository (e.g., using `git`).
    - Configure application settings.
    - Build and deploy software to a server.
    - Restart services.

These are just a few examples. The possibilities are vast! As you become more comfortable with Bash scripting, you'll find countless ways to automate repetitive tasks and make your work more efficient.

### Error Handling and Logging

When you write scripts, things don't always go according to plan. Files might be missing, commands might fail, or users might provide unexpected input. Good scripts anticipate these issues and handle them gracefully.

#### Error Handling

**Error Handling**:

- **Exit Status**: As we briefly touched on with functions, every command in Bash returns an **exit status**. A status of `0` typically indicates success, while any non-zero status indicates failure. You can check the exit status of the last command using the special variable `$?`.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    cp non_existent_file.txt backup.txt
    if [ "$?" -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Error: Failed to copy the file."
      exit 1 # Exit the script with an error status
    fi
    echo "File copied successfully."
    exit 0 # Exit the script with a success status
    ```

- **Conditional Execution with** `&&` **and** `||`: These operators allow you to chain commands based on their exit status:

  - `command1 && command2`: Execute `command2` only if `command1` succeeds (returns an exit status of 0).
  - `command1 || command2`: Execute `command2` only if `command1` fails (returns a non-zero exit status).

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    mkdir data_dir && cd data_dir # Create directory and then change into it only if creation succeeds
    rm important_file || echo "Warning: Failed to remove important_file."
    ```

- **Trapping Signals**: You can use the `trap` command to specify actions to be taken when the script receives certain signals (e.g., when the user presses Ctrl+C, which sends the `SIGINT` signal). This allows you to perform cleanup tasks before the script exits.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    cleanup() {
      echo "Performing cleanup..."
      rm -f temp_file
    }

    trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM EXIT # Call cleanup on Ctrl+C, termination, or normal exit

    echo "Script started. Creating a temporary file..."
    touch temp_file
    sleep 10
    echo "Script finished."
    # The cleanup function will be called when the script finishes or is interrupted
    ```

#### Logging

**Logging**:

Logging is the practice of recording events that occur during the execution of your script. This can be invaluable for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

- **Basic Logging with** `echo` **and Redirection**: You can simply use `echo` to print messages to a log file using redirection:

    ```Bash

    #!/bin/bash
    LOG_FILE="script.log"
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    echo "$TIMESTAMP - Script started." >> "$LOG_FILE"

    # ... your script commands ...

    if [ "$?" -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "$TIMESTAMP - Error occurred." >> "$LOG_FILE"
    else
      echo "$TIMESTAMP - Script completed successfully." >> "$LOG_FILE"
    fi
    ```

- **Using** `logger` **Command**: The `logger` utility provides a more standardized way to write to the system log.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    logger "Script started."
    # ... your script commands ...
    if [ "$?" -ne 0 ]; then
      logger -p user.error "Error in script."
    else
      logger -p user.info "Script completed successfully."
    fi
    ```

    Log messages written with logger can often be viewed using system log tools (like journalctl on Linux).

Implementing proper error handling and logging makes your scripts more reliable, easier to debug, and provides valuable insights into their execution.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They provide a way to configure applications and scripts without directly modifying their code. Bash scripts can both access existing environment variables and set their own.

#### Accessing Environment Variables

**Accessing Environment Variables**:

You can access the value of an environment variable in your Bash scripts using the dollar sign $ followed by the variable name (similar to how you access regular variables).

```Bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Your home directory is: $HOME"
echo "Your current user is: $USER"
echo "Your operating system is: $OSTYPE"
echo "The path to executable files is in: $PATH"
```

These are just a few examples of common environment variables that are usually set by your system.

#### Setting Environment Variables

**Setting Environment Variables**:

You can set your own environment variables in your scripts using the `export` command.

- **To set a variable that is only available within the current script**:

    ```Bash
    MY_VARIABLE="my_value"
    echo "Inside the script: $MY_VARIABLE"
    ```

- **To set a variable that will be available to the current script and any child processes it creates (i.e., commands or other scripts run from this script), you use** `export`:

    ```Bash
    export MY_EXPORTED_VARIABLE="exported_value"
    echo "Inside the script: $MY_EXPORTED_VARIABLE"
    ```

    When a script sets an exported environment variable, that variable will be in the environment of any commands or scripts that are executed by that script. However, it will not affect the environment of the parent shell (the terminal where you ran the script) once the script finishes.

#### Common Use Cases for Environment Variables in Scripts

**Common Use Cases for Environment Variables in Scripts**:

- **Configuration**: Instead of hardcoding paths or settings within a script, you can use environment variables to make the script more flexible. Users can then configure the script's behavior by setting these variables before running it.
- **Passing Information**: Environment variables can be used to pass information between a parent script and child scripts or commands.
- **Accessing System Information**: As seen in the first example, they provide access to various system settings and user information.

**Example Script Using Environment Variables**:

```Bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a custom log directory is set, otherwise use a default
if [ -z "$LOG_DIR" ]; then
  LOG_DIR="./logs"
fi

# Create the log directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$LOG_DIR"

LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/my_script.log"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

echo "$TIMESTAMP - Script started." >> "$LOG_FILE"

# ... your script commands ...

echo "$TIMESTAMP - Script finished." >> "$LOG_FILE"
```

In this script, the user can optionally set the `LOG_DIR` environment variable before running the script to specify where the log files should be stored. If the variable is not set, the script defaults to a `./logs` directory.

Understanding and using environment variables is a key aspect of writing flexible and well-configured Bash scripts.

### Working with Command-Line Arguments

Just like you can pass arguments to the script itself when you run it from the terminal (e.g., `./my_script.sh input.txt output.log`), your scripts can access and use these arguments. This makes your scripts more flexible and allows users to customize their behavior when they run them.

Inside your Bash script, the command-line arguments are stored in special positional parameters, similar to how function arguments are handled:

- `$0`: Represents the name of the script itself.
- `$1`: Represents the first argument passed to the script.
- `$2`: Represents the second argument.
- `$3`: Represents the third argument, and so on.
- `$#`: Contains the total number of arguments passed to the script (excluding the script name $0).
- `$*`: Contains all the arguments (starting from `$1`) as a single string, separated by spaces.
- `$@`: Contains all the arguments (starting from `$1`) as separate words (generally safer to use for iteration).

**Example**:

Let's create a simple script that takes a name as a command-line argument and greets that person:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -eq 1 ]; then
  NAME="$1"
  echo "Hello, $NAME!"
elif [ "$#" -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <name>"
  echo "Too many arguments provided."
  exit 1
else
  echo "Usage: $0 <name>"
  echo "Please provide a name as an argument."
  exit 1
fi
```

If you save this script as `greet.sh` and run it like this:

```bash
./greet.sh Alice
```

The output will be:

```shell
Hello, Alice!
```

If you run it with no arguments or more than one argument, it will display a usage message and exit with an error status.

**Using** `$*` **and** `$@` **to Process Multiple Arguments**:

If your script needs to process multiple arguments, you can use `$*` or `$@` in loops:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Number of arguments: $#"

echo "Processing arguments using \$@:"
for arg in "$@"; do
  echo "Argument: $arg"
done

echo "Processing arguments using \$*:"
for arg in $*; do
  echo "Argument: $arg"
done
```

If you run this script with `./process_args.sh one "two three" four`, the output will highlight the difference in how `$@` and `$*` handle quoted arguments.

Handling command-line arguments is essential for creating scripts that can be used in a variety of situations and can be easily integrated into other workflows.
