# The Self Hosted Server Survival Guide

Welcome to the **Self-Hosted Server Survival Guide**, a resource for those looking to take control of their own infrastructure. This book is divided into two distinct parts.

The first part focuses on hands-on projects, demonstrating different applications that can be hosted from a personal server at home. Each example is designed as a functional setup, providing real experience with deployment and management.

The second part is a collection of technical manuals, covering the essential components of system administration, networking, security, and software configurations. These references serve as a deep dive into the inner workings of a server environment, building a stronger foundation for understanding and troubleshooting.

Designed as a living document, the plan is to have this guide evolve alongside new technologies and discoveries, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for beginners and experienced users alike.

Aside from manuals, and articles this project aims to provide external resources to other organizations and learning documentation in the future as well.
